This was my senior project that I worked on with 3 other students. For this project, we built a full-stack web application using C#, .NET Core, Razor Pages, and EF Core. This is a clone of the original repository*, adapted for portfolio purposes so that information pertaining to our Azure account has been removed and replaced with SQL Server localdb.

This project is a full-stack web application designed to be the Electronic Medical Records system for a hypothetical Ophthalmology office. I was the Tools Lead for the project, which entailed teaching myself EF Core and Razors Pages, and then teaching those technologies to the other group members.
